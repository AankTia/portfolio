# Alodokter Monolith Service Portfolio Detail

alodokter-monolith-service

## Project Overview
**Client:** Alodokter  
**Role:** Fullstack Developer  
**Year:** 2018

## Project Description
Initiated and implemented a strategic architectural transition by creating a dedicated monolith service to separately handle Alodokter & Alomedika mobile applications. This critical initiative separated API requests for consumer-facing apps from back-office operations, which were previously combined in a single system, resulting in improved performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Contributions

### Architecture Design
- Designed the architecture for the new monolith service with a focus on separation of concerns
- Created a clean API structure optimized for mobile application needs
- Implemented a scalable foundation capable of supporting growing user demand
- Established clear boundaries between consumer-facing and administrative functionalities

### Migration Strategy
- Developed a phased migration approach to ensure continuous service availability
- Created a comprehensive data migration plan to maintain data integrity
- Implemented backward compatibility layers to support transitioning clients
- Designed and executed testing strategies to validate the migration success

### Performance Optimization
- Tailored database queries specifically for mobile application requirements
- Implemented Redis caching strategies to enhance response times for frequently accessed data
- Optimized Elasticsearch configurations for efficient content search functionality
- Created performance benchmarks to measure improvements over the previous system

### Authentication & Security
- Implemented Devise for robust authentication management
- Created role-based access control tailored to application requirements
- Established secure API communication channels between services
- Implemented comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### Development Operations
- Set up automated testing and continuous integration pipelines with Bitbucket
- Configured Sidekiq for background job processing to handle non-critical operations
- Established monitoring and logging infrastructure for the new service
- Created developer documentation to support ongoing maintenance and feature development

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoid ORM
- **Caching:** Redis
- **Search:** Elasticsearch
- **Version Control:** Bitbucket
- **API Design:** RESTful API
- **Background Processing:** Sidekiq
- **Authentication:** Devise

## Results
The successful implementation of the dedicated monolith service significantly improved application performance, simplified maintenance workflows, and established a more scalable architecture for Alodokter and Alomedika's mobile applications. This architectural separation created a foundation for future growth and laid the groundwork for later microservices adoption.
