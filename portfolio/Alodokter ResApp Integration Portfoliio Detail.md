# Alodokter ResApp Integration Portfoliio Detail

## Project Overview
**Client:** Alodokter  
**Role:** Senior Fullstack Developer

## Project Description

Contributed to the integration between Alodokter and ResApp, a cutting-edge AI-powered diagnostic tool that analyzes cough sounds to detect respiratory illnesses such as asthma, pneumonia. This integration enabled seamless data exchange between the Alodokter app and ResApp, enhancing remote diagnostics and accessibility to respiratory disease testing.  

## **How It Works:**  
1. **Cough sound recording** – The Alodokter app captures a cough using the smartphone’s microphone.  
2. **Data transmission** – The recorded sound is securely sent to ResApp for analysis.  
3. **AI-powered diagnosis** – ResApp’s machine learning system evaluates cough patterns, along with symptoms like fever or a runny nose.  
4. **Results delivery** – The diagnostic results are returned to Alodokter, assisting doctors in making **faster and more accurate diagnoses**.  

## **Key Contributions:**  
- **Developed and optimized** backend APIs to facilitate real-time communication between Alodokter and ResApp.  
- **Ensured secure data transmission** and compliance with health data regulations.  
- **Implemented caching and performance optimizations** using **Redis and Sidekiq** to handle high-volume requests efficiently.  
- **Integrated ElasticSearch** for quick retrieval of diagnostic history.  
- **Enhanced system reliability and scalability** to support increased user demand.  

## **Benefits:**  
✔ **Faster and more accessible diagnosis** for respiratory diseases.  
✔ **Reduced reliance on invasive testing** (e.g., nasal swabs) for children.  
✔ **Expanded healthcare access** in remote areas with limited RAT or PCR test availability.  
✔ **Improved doctor decision-making** through AI-assisted diagnostics.  

## **Tools & Technologies:**  
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails, MongoDB (Mongoid ORM), Redis, Sidekiq  
- **Search & Caching:** ElasticSearch, Redis  
- **Version Control & CI/CD:** Bitbucket  
- **API Development:** REST API  

## Goals
This integration **transformed Alodokter into a smarter, AI-enhanced healthcare platform**, improving **diagnostic speed, accessibility, and efficiency** for both doctors and patients.
